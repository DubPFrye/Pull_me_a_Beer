# Pull_me_a_Beer
3D Printed Beer Shotgun Device
This is a project to develop a device that can perform a beer shotgun operation.

 The device shall be all or mostly 3D printed.

The device shall perform two operations successively:
- Pierce a beverage can and form a seal around the pierced location.
- Crush the can and expel the contents through the pierced opening.

The device shall be operated by one person, the same as consuming the bevearge.
A single person shall be able to to perform the pierce/crush operation and consume the beverage. 

The mechanism has a unique force profile. It must have a large mechanical advantage during the first part of the operation to begin the crushing. After the can begins to crush, the force to deliver the beverage is relatively low. Toward the end of the can crush, the can density increases and the force profile increases again. 

Two designs have been considered.

The first design, "Beer Shotgunner", uses a lever pull to provide crushing force. The mechanical advantage is greater at the beginning of the operation which works to provide extra force for the pierce and initial crush operations. The main weakness of this design is that the the end of the operation, the operator force on the handles pulls the device in the direction of the mouthpiece. This would be uncomfortable for the operator.

The second design, "Pull me a Beer", uses a linear pull with multiple scissor linkages for mechanical advantage. This design eliminates force on the mouthpiece. It also has extra high force at the beginning of the pull to assist with initial crush, and a more rapid crush motion during the beverage ejection phase. Unfortunately it still does not feature an increased mechanical advantage at the end of the pull to match the extra force required to fully crush the can. in fact it contunues to lose mechanical advanyage all the way to the end of travel. 

The current design challenge is to elegantly implement the final mechanical advantage change so that the operator can easily complete the crush operation and expel the last of the beverage through the mouthpiece. Design inspiration may be derived from existing wall mounted can crushers which employ a moving fulcrum to create a strong/fast/strong force profile, since these were developed for the crushing of beverage cans.
